# 1. Important Notes

---

## 1. Stories

### This task can't be accomplished as it's mentioned in the task document, due to many reasons like:

- the method that was designed count on enable the user to see other users' stories and upload a new story and this isn't possible because we don't have an authentication system at all so we can't host users and upload stories for others and reply to it !

## 2. Responsive design

### There's problems in some screens that are between the range of 1920 and 1440 but the screen sizes that are 1920 and 1440 are well-designed

### the mobile app design wasn't clear that's for web and just for RN therefore I ignored it
